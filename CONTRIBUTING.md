# How can I contribute with this project?

If you're reading this, my most sincere thank you. This is a project created through the Omnistack Week 10 webcourse.

In the beginning I tried to follow all the instructions and adopt their suggested material. As of today, I keep studying ReactJS
(and its relatives) and trying to apply more of my newly acquired knowledge into this application.

If you want to contribute, feel free to open issues or send me pull requests informing what I could do better, aside from tips and suggestions.

### Thank you for your interest.
